# TARBS



About TARBS
===========
This script is basically a copy of Luke Smith's LARBS (Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts). It sets you up with a fresh i3-gaps install, just like LARBS, but with my configurations and my own personal preferences. It also installs a bootloader in case you dont have one already. The main difference Between TARBS and LARBS is that this script lets you choose whether you want to install non-critical programs (with my configurations) and some other system configuration files. You can read more about LARBS on https://larbs.xyz

The code used in this script is mostly written by the people maintaining the ArchLabs distribution. That distribution is very nice and has an awesome installer, which I based this one on. Seriously, most of the code here is just copy pasted from their installer, check them out at https://archlabslinux.com.
